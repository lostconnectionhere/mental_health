    "In this jupyter notebook I will explore the data that was found on Kaggle about Mental Health. The data consists of several factors, such as countries, years, mental and substance use, prevalence of depression and so on. This dataset will mainly be used to learn more skills, such as plotting data on world map and more useful and easy to read and understand visualisations.\n",
